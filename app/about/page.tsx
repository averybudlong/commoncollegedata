          Instruction expenses per FTE enrollment for public and
          private-not-for-profit institutions using FASB standards is derived as
          follows: Instruction expenses (F2E011) divided by 12-month FTE
          enrollment (FTE12MN) Instruction - A functional expense category that
          includes expenses of the colleges, schools, departments, and other
          instructional divisions of the institution and expenses for
          departmental research and public service that are not separately
          budgeted. Includes general academic instruction, occupational and
          vocational instruction, community education, preparatory and adult
          basic education, and regular, special, and extension sessions. Also
          includes expenses for both credit and non-credit activities. Excludes
          expenses for academic administration where the primary function is
          administration (e.g., academic deans). Information technology expenses
          related to instructional activities if the institution separately
          budgets and expenses information technology resources are included
          (otherwise these expenses are included in academic support). FASB
          institutions include actual or allocated costs for operation and
          maintenance of plant, interest, and depreciation. GASB institutions do
          not include operation and maintenance of plant or interest, but may,
          as an option, distribute depreciation expense. The
          full-time-equivalent (FTE) enrollment used is the sum of the
          institutions’ FTE undergraduate enrollment and FTE graduate enrollment
          (as calculated from or reported on the 12-month Enrollment component)
          plus the estimated FTE of first-professional students. Undergraduate
          and graduate FTE are estimated using 12-month instructional activity
          (credit and/or clock hours). For more information see the variable
          description for 12-month full-time equivalent enrollment (info link)
          under frequently used\ 12-month enrollment.

          Core revenues,total dollars for public and private-not-for-profit
          institutions using FASB standards are derived by adding revenues from
          the following sources: Tuition and fees revenues (F2D01) Federal
          appropriations (F2D02) State appropriations (F2D03) Local
          appropriations (F2D04) Federal grants and contracts (F2D05) State
          grants and contracts (F2D06) Local grants and contracts (F2D07)
          Private gifts, grants, and contracts (F2D08) Contributions from
          affiliated entities (F2D09) Investment return (F2D10) Sales and
          services of educational activities (F2D11) Other revenues (F2D15) For
          glossary definitions of the above finance terms see variables listed
          under the Finance survey.

          Research expenses per FTE enrollment for public and
          private-not-for-profit institutions using FASB standards is derived as
          follows: Research expenses (F2E021) divided by 12-month FTE enrollment
          (FTE12MN) Research (expense) - A functional expense category that
          includes expenses for activities specifically organized to produce
          research outcomes and commissioned by an agency either external to the
          institution or separately budgeted by an organizational unit within
          the institution. The category includes institutes and research
          centers, and individual and project research. This function does not
          include nonresearch sponsored programs (e.g., training programs). Also
          included are information technology expenses related to research
          activities if the institution separately budgets and expenses
          information technology resources (otherwise these expenses are
          included in academic support.) FASB institutions include actual or
          allocated costs for operation & maintenance of plant, interest, and
          depreciation. GASB institutions do not include operation & maintenance
          of plant or interest but may, as an option, distribute depreciation
          expense. The full-time-equivalent (FTE) enrollment used is the sum of
          the institutions’ FTE undergraduate enrollment and FTE graduate
          enrollment (as calculated from or reported on the 12-month Enrollment
          component) plus the estimated FTE of first-professional students.
          Undergraduate and graduate FTE are estimated using 12-month
          instructional activity (credit and/or clock hours). For more
          information see the variable description for 12-month full-time
          equivalent enrollment (info link) under frequently used\ 12-month
          enrollment.

          Endowment assets (year end) per FTE enrollment for public and private
          not-for-profit institutions using FASB standards is derived as
          follows: Endowment assets (year end) (F2H02) divided by 12-month FTE
          enrollment (FTE12MN) Endowment assets are gross investments of
          endowment funds, term endowment funds, and funds functioning as
          endowment for the institution and any of its foundations and other
          affiliated organizations. Endowment funds are funds whose principal is
          nonexpendable (true endowment) and that are intended to be invested to
          provide earnings for institutional use. Term endowment funds are funds
          which the donor has stipulated that the principal may be expended
          after a stated period or on the occurrence of a certain event. Funds
          functioning as endowment (quasi-endowment funds) are established by
          the governing board to function like an endowment fund but which may
          be totally expended at any time at the discretion of the governing
          board. These funds represent nonmandatory transfers from the current
          fund rather than a direct addition to the endowment fund, as occurs
          for the true endowment categories. The full-time-equivalent (FTE)
          enrollment used is the sum of the institutions’ FTE undergraduate
          enrollment and FTE graduate enrollment (as calculated from or reported
          on the 12-month Enrollment component) plus the estimated FTE of
          first-professional students. Undergraduate and graduate FTE are
          estimated using 12-month instructional activity (credit and/or clock
          hours). For more information see the variable description for 12-month
          full-time equivalent enrollment (info link) under frequently used\
          12-month enrollment.
